/*
You are given a map of a building, and your task is to count the number of its rooms. The size of
the map is n√óm squares, and each square is either floor or wall. You can walk left, right, up, and
down through the floor squares.

Input: The first input line has two integers n and m: the height and width of the map. Then there
are n lines of m characters describing the map. Each character is either . (floor) or # (wall).
Output: Print one integer: the number of rooms.
ex. input:
5 8
########
#..#...#
####.#.#
#..#...#
########
output:
3

Notes:
- same approach as wheres-my-internet where you dfs a starting room and keep tabs on the nodes that
have not been visited
- continue to search the unvisited nodes until you have no unvisited nodes left, increment a counter
each time you start a search (since a connected group of unvisited nodes is a single room)
