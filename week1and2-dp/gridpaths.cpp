/*
Consider an NÃ—N grid whose squares may have traps. It is not allowed to move to a square with a trap.
Your task is to calculate the number of paths from the upper-left square to the lower-right square.
You can only move right or down.

notes:
- if there are no traps, you can answer right away
    - we know we must do M moves to the right and N moves to the bottom
    - choose N from M+N = (M+N)!/(M!N!) different ways if there were no traps
- big idea: for a single cell there are 2 ways to get to it, either from the left or above
- K1 ways to getting to a cell from the left, K2 ways to get to that cell from above = K1+K2 ways to reach that cell

make a 2D array which stores however many ways there are to get to cell [i][j]
1 way to get to the starting cell, only 1 way to get anwhere is first column and first row
0 ways to get to a trap
fill this array in a for loop row-by-row

for i = 1 -> N dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0]
dp[0][i] ]
for i = 1 -> N
for i = 1 -> M
[i][j] = [i-1][j] + [i][j-1]

take care of first row and first column first then move on from there
