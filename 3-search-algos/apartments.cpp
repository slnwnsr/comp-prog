/*
There are n applicants and m apartments, and n applicants will accept an apartment within the acceptable range.
Input:
The first input line has three integers n, m, and k: the number of applicants, the number of apartments,
and the maximum allowed difference.
The next line contains n integers a1, ..., an: the desired apartment size of applicant i If the desired
size of an applicant is x, he or she will accept any apartment whose size is between xâˆ’k and x+k.
The last line contains m integers b1, ..., bm: the size of each apartment.
Output:
Print one integer: the number of applicants who will get an apartment.
Ex. input:          output:
4 3 5               2
60 45 80 60
30 60 75

Notes:
- Have two pointers for each array, and move them based on if the other pointer's value is valid or not
